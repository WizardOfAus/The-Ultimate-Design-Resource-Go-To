- Build Your Tool Kit
This week we’ll jump into Photoshop where you’ll learn how to cut out and manipulate assets to create images that entertain and inform. You’ll even have your first taste of what it’s like to work with direction from a Creative Director.

- Catchup Week: Familiar Feelings
Take a week off to catch up on any lessons and homework you’re behind on. You’ll get a short primer on the history of Adobe software, and why a lot of the tools you’ve been using feel very similar even though they’re in different programs.

- Designing Your Ideas
Let’s dive even deeper into the software and explore tools and techniques that will help you build up your design chops. By the end of this week you’ll be more confident and ready for an even bigger challenge.
